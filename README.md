## List of Python Projects for Learning  

### For Beginners
- [x] Calculator:
    - Tips: Use functions (def) for each operation (addition, subtraction, etc.). Add input from the keyboard (input) and error handling with try/except.
    - Libraries: Python built-in functions. For an advanced version, you can use the math library (e.g., for calculating square roots or trigonometric functions).

- [x] Password Generator:
    - Tips: Use the random module to select random characters. Create a string of letters, numbers, and special characters (string.ascii_letters, string.digits, string.punctuation).
    - Libraries: random, string.
    - Difficulty example: Add the ability to set the password length or choose which characters to include.

- [x] Habit Tracker:
    - Tips: Use dictionaries (dict) to store habits and their status. Implement a menu with options (e.g., add a habit, mark as completed, view statistics).
    - Libraries: Python built-in functions. For saving data between program runs, you can use pickle or json.

- [x] Quiz:
    - Tips: Create questions and options as a list of dictionaries. Use a counter variable for keeping track of the score.
    - Libraries: Python built-in functions. Store questions in JSON files.

### Intermediate Level
- [ ] Web Scraper:
    - Tips: Use the requests library to fetch HTML code from a page and BeautifulSoup to extract data (e.g., headlines, currency exchange rates, or weather).
    - Libraries: requests, beautifulsoup4.
    - Difficulty example: Add error handling for unavailable sites or changes in page structure.

- [ ] Telegram Bot:
    - Tips: Register the bot via BotFather on Telegram. Use the python-telegram-bot or aiogram library for interaction. Implement message and command handling.
    - Libraries: python-telegram-bot, aiogram.
    - Difficulty example: Add a database to store user information (sqlite3, SQLAlchemy).

- [ ] Note Manager:
    - Tips: Use text files (.txt) or SQLite to store notes. Implement functions for adding, deleting, editing, and searching for notes.
    - Libraries: sqlite3, os, json.
    - Difficulty example: Add the ability to sort notes by date or tags.

- [ ] Data Visualization and Graphs:
    - Tips: Create an array of data (e.g., temperature over a week) and visualize it using matplotlib or seaborn.
    - Libraries: matplotlib, seaborn, pandas.
    - Difficulty example: Load data from a CSV file or API, then plot graphs.

### Advanced Level
- [ ] Mini-game:
    - Tips: Use the pygame library to create a graphical interface. For a "snake" game, implement movement logic by updating coordinates on the screen.
    - Libraries: pygame.
    - Difficulty example: Add saving high scores to a file and difficulty levels.

- [ ] Flask/Django Website:
    - Tips: Start with a simple website using Flask (e.g., a blog). Use HTML templates and routing. For more complex projects, use Django with its ORM.
    - Libraries: Flask, Django, Jinja2, SQLite3.
    - Difficulty example: Add a user registration and authentication system.

- [ ] Machine Learning:
    - Tips: Find a dataset (e.g., from Kaggle). Use scikit-learn to load data, analyze it, and create a model.
    - Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.
    - Difficulty example: Build predictions using classification or regression models.

- [ ] AI Chatbot:
    - Tips: Use an API (e.g., OpenAI API) to create a chatbot. Implement message handling and send them to the model.
    - Libraries: requests, openai, python-telegram-bot.
    - Difficulty example: Add the ability to save chat history.

### For Portfolio
- [ ] File Management System:
    - Tips: Use the os and shutil modules for file handling. Implement sorting by extension, archiving, and removing old files.
    - Libraries: os, shutil, zipfile.

- [ ] Task Automation:
    - Tips: Write a script to automate routine tasks (e.g., sending emails via smtplib or backing up files).
    - Libraries: os, smtplib, schedule, time.

- [ ] Weather Forecasting:
    - Tips: Use the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data. Display current weather and the forecast for several days ahead.
    - Libraries: requests, json, argparse (for the command line).
